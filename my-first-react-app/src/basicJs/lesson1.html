      We know that let variable is introduced ES6 version of Javascript. Let us
      see why it got introduced.
      <br />
      <br />
      Let us take a function that gets a number nand prints number sequence from
      1 to n:
      <br />
      <div>
        function printNum(n){
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;for(var i=1;i<=n;i++){
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;console.log(i);
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;}
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;console.log(i); <==
        <br />
        }printNum(3);
        <br />
      </div>
      Note according to object oriented programming it should not print
      4(console.log(i) matked with <==) as variable i is declared inside for
      loop which is not accessible outside for loop. It shouldn't print 4 as it
      is not defined outside for loop scope. But here it prints 4.So what
      happens?
      <br />
      <br />
      When we declare a variable using var keyword inside a loop which is inside
      a function, var makes accessible anywhere inside the function but not
      outside the function. To come out of this issue we use let keyword.
      <br />
      <br />
      So here is the conclusion variables declared with var are scoped to the
      function whereas variables declared with let are scoped to the the block
      where it is defined. Variables declared using const are similar to let
      which is scoped to the block where they are defined. The only difference
      between let and const is const doesn't allow reassigning a variable. For
      example:
      <br />
      const x = 8;
      <br />
      x=10;
      <br />
      throws ar error.
