        Now our Javascript code started becoming big. So, instead writing
        everything in one file we can split the code in files. This method is
        called modularity. And we call each file modules.
        <br />
        <br />
        In old days we didn't have modules so they where using third party
        applications. But from ES6, concept of modules is present natively in
        Javascript.
        <br />
        <br />
        now we can move each class to different file and add export infront of
        every class so that they can be used in other files.
        <br />
        <br />
        But at this point we still can't use classes from other file as they are
        private. So now we add import stetement to every file. So our code looks
        like This.

        <div class="code">
          import { Person1 } from "./lesson11";
          <br />
          export class Developer {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; constructor(name,age,role) {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.name = name;
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.age = age;
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.role = role;
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; }
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; printRole(){
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log(this.role);
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; }
