        In Javascript we always access properties and methods using dot
        notation. So, if you want to store a property in a variable we use the
        following method.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="code">
            const marks = {
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; physics: 75,
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; chemistry: 80,
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; maths: 82
            <br />
            };
            <br />
            const physics = marks.physics;
            <br />
            const chemistry = marks.chemistry;
            <br />
            const maths = marks.maths;
            <br />
            console.log(physics,chemistry,maths);
          </div>
          <div class="explanation">
            We need to extract the value of these properties, and store them in
            separate variables. So this is what we typically do. We have to
            access each and every object using dot notation and store it in
            variables.
            <br />
            <br />
            So you have to repetitively use marks. to access the property. In
            modern Javascript we have something called Destructuring that solves
            this problem.

        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="code">
            const marks = {
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; physics: 75,
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; chemistry: 80,
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; maths: 82
            <br />
            };
            <br />
            const {physics:phy, chemistry:chem, maths: mat} = marks; <==
            <br />
            console.log(phy,chem,mat);
          </div>
          <div class="explanation">
            We can rewrite the above code like this. Let us see what code marked
            with <== does. It takes physics, chemistry, maths properties from
            marks and assign it to variable py, chem, mat. So this is exactly
            same as
            <br />
            const phy = marks.physics;
            <br />
            const chem = marks.chemistry;
            <br />
            const mat = marks.maths;
            <br />
            <br />
            It is not necessary that you have to access all property if yoou use
            this method. If you want one property then you can access that
            alone. And if name of the variable is exactly same as property that
            you are accessing then the code becomes more cleaner.
            <br />
            const {physics} = marks;
          </div>
