        This keyword works differently in JavaScript. Let us look at it.
        <div>
          const opertions = {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; num1: 10,
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; num2:8,
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; demoPrint() {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log(this) <==
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; }
          <br />
          };
          <br />
          opertions.demoPrint();//1.
          <br />
          const demoPrint= opertions.demoPrint;//2.
          <br />
          console.log(demoPrint);
          <br />
          demoPrint();
          <br />
        </div>
        <br />
        When we write operations.demoPrint() (1.), this keyword returns refernce
        to operations object. But this keyword doesn't work in the same way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead of calling a method let us now refernce a method and assign it
        to a variable(2.). Note,
        <em>opertions.demoPrint</em>
        is not calling method demoPrint. We are just getting refernce to that
        method. To call we add parantheses
        <em>opertions.demoPrint()</em>
        . Still confusing, let us console.log demoPrint constant. Look you get a
        refernce to that function. Now, what happens when we call this demoPrint
        constant. We get something different, Why?.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's why I told you that the this keyword in JavaScript behaves
        differently from other programming languages. The value of this is
        determined by how a function is called. If we call a function as a
        method in an object(opertions.demoPrint();), this will always return a
        reference to that object.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, if we call a function as a stand alone object, or outside of an
        object, this will return the global object which is the window object in
        browsers. Note here const demoPrint= opertions.demoPrint; we reference a
        method in object. But when you call it is not considered as calling a
        method it is considered as calling a funtion, since we referenced a
        method it is no more considered as method in an object.
