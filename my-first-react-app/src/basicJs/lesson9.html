        Let's say we have two arrays and we have to combine two arrays. We do
        this in following manner:
        <br />
        let arr1 = ["Hi","Hello"];
        <br />
        let arr2 = ["Welcome"," Hey"];
        <br />
        let greet = arr1.concat(arr2);
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In modern Javascript we use spread operator to do this.
        <br />
        let greet1 = [...arr1,...arr2];
        <br />
        What we do here. Well spread operator is represented using three dots
        where we spread the first array, and that means we'll get every item in
        this array and put it in our new array. And then similarly we'll spread
        the second array.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        You may say there's not really a difference between two ways of merging
        2 arrays in terms of the length of the code, so why is this an
        improvement. Well, what if you wanted to add an element in somewhere in
        the middle and at the end. When you use concat operator your code looks
        like this
        <br />
        let greet3 = arr1.concat("Hi everybody");
        <br />
        greet3 = greet3.concat(arr2);
        <br />
        greet3 = greet3.concat("Hey all");
        <br />
        <br />
        But when you use spread operator your code looks much cleaner: let
        greet2 = [...arr1,"Hi everybody",...arr2, "Hey all"];
        <br />
      </div>
    </div>
