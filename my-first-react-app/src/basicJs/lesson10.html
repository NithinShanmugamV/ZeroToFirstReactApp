        Spread opertor is also used in cloning an array.
        <br />
        <br />
        let arr1 = ["Hi","Hello"];
        <br />
        let clone= [...arr1];
        <br />
        <br />
        Now we can also apply the spread operator on objects to merge two
        objects.
        <br />
        <br />
        let obj1 = {
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; firstName:"Nithin"
        <br />
        };
        <br />
        let obj2 = {
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; secondName:"Shanmugam"
        <br />
        };
        <br />
        let combined = {...obj1,...obj2}
        <br />
        console.log(combined);
        <br />
        <br />
        Note we used spread operator in {} instead of [] because last time we
        used array which is represented in square brackets. Now we use objects
        which is represented in object literal syntax. Also while using spread
        operator in objects we can also optionally add additional properties to
        it.
        <br />
        let combined1 = {...obj1,...obj2, age: 20};
        <br />
        <br />
        similarly we can use spread operator to clone an object
        <br />
        let combined2 = {...combined1};
