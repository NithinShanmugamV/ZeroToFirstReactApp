        Let's say you have an object. What if you want to create another object
        with same methods and properties. You may try to duplicate it by copying
        the code and pasting it and change name. But what if
        <ul>
          <li>The object has more than 10 lines of code.</li>
          <li>The object has bug in it and you need to change every object.</li>
        </ul>
        So here we need to create something like a blueprint that can create
        objects and if there is a bug it is enough to change that blueprint. We
        can do this by using classes.
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="code">
            class Person {
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; constructor(name,age) {
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.name = name,
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.age = age;
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; }
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; print(){
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log(this.name,this.age);
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; }
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; info(){
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return this.name,this.age;
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; }
            <br />
            }
            <br />
            const person1 = new Person("Nithin",20);
            <br />
            console.log(person1.info());
            <br />
            person1.print();
          </div>
          <div class="explanation">
            We use pascal notation convention for naming classes. We need to add
            another method here called constructor, so just like the print
            method, constructor is a method, but the name is reserved.
            <br />
            Now this constructor can take parameters, so we can pass the name
            from the outside and initialize it here. How, well, we use this, in
            this case this always returns a reference to the current object, so
            we set the name property of that object to this name argument that
            we receive from the outside.
            <br />
            To create a person object person, we set it to a new person object.
            When we have a class, to create an object, using that class, we need
            to use the new operator. If you ignore the new keyword for a second,
            this expression looks like calling a function. And that's exactly
            our constructor method in the person class.
