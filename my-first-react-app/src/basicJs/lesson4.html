        In last webpage we understood that if you return a reference of object
        method to a variable and call it, it returns window object. What if I
        say that we can fix this issue and make it look like a calling a method.
        <br />
        <br />
        We all knew that function is an object made by in-built object called
        Function(). There is an method for this Function() object called bind
        which can bind this method to an object.
        <br />

        <div>
          const opertions = {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; num1: 10,
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; num2:8,
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; demoPrint() {
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log(this) <==
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; }
          <br />
          };
          <br />
          const demoPrint= opertions.demoPrint.bind(opertions)
          <br />
          demoPrint();
        </div>
        <br />
        What did it do? Well bind functions takes a parameter as operations and
        will return a new instance of this demoPrint function. And set this to
        point to operations object. So, now when we call this demoPrint
        function, we will see this person object on the console.
