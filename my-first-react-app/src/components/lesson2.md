Let us create our first component. Let us add a folder called components which by convention means we put all our components here.
Now let us create a module called counter by adding new file called counter.jsx to components folder.
Use camel notations for naming files.
We can use both .js and .jsx extensions. I highly encourage you to use the jsx extension instead of just js, because with this you will get better code completion.
import react and component class in this file.
