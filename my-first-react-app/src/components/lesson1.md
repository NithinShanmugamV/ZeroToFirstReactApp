Our new project is ready, so let's go to this folder, my-first-react app.
Now we need to install bootstrap, we need to go back in terminal (in vs code you can use integrated terminal)type npm i bootstrap.
In case you are not familiar with bootstrap, it's basically a css library, that gives our applications a modern look and feel.
Finally we need to import this in index.js, so, let's open up index.js.
Here on top, we need to add another import statement. 
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

```
dist is short for distributable. So this is how we import bootstrap css in our application.
